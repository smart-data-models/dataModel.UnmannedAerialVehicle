# dataModel.UnmannedAerialVehicle

### List of data models

The following entity types are available:
- [UnmannedAerialVehicle](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.UnmannedAerialVehicle/blob/master/UnmannedAerialVehicle/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a specific Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). This entity is primarily associated with UAV command and control and related UAV transport applications.

- [UnmannedAerialVehicleADSB](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.UnmannedAerialVehicle/blob/master/UnmannedAerialVehicleADSB/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic UnmannedAutonomousVehicle (UAV) Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast. This entity is primarily associated with the control and management of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. Each UAVADSB instance will be related to a specific UAV instance.

- [UnmannedAerialVehicleEvent](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.UnmannedAerialVehicle/blob/master/UnmannedAerialVehicleEvent/README.md). The UAVEvent records the incursion of a specific UAV into or near protected airspace or locations. It also records the control measure taken. This entity is primarily associated with UAV command and control and related UAV transport applications.

- [UnmannedAerialVehicleModel](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.UnmannedAerialVehicle/blob/master/UnmannedAerialVehicleModel/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic Unmanned Ariel Vehicle (UAV) model and is applicable to UAV command and control and related UAV transport applications.

- [UnmannedAerialVehicleTMS](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.UnmannedAerialVehicle/blob/master/UnmannedAerialVehicleTMS/README.md). This entity contains a harmonized description of a specific Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Traffic Management Software Application that is designed to listen to and monitor the information transmitted by UAV’s, typically this software application would be operated at a ground station. This entity is primarily associated with UAV command and control applications.
